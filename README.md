## NFL Zahlen

Zaheln? Because I couldn't think of another name and it's *numbers* in German.

So, the NFL is the sport I'm most interested/passionate about. I worked with a few teams during my time at a sports tech start-up and got to see what it was like - awesome!

The interests has only gotten stronger, from the rise of tracking data with [Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/) and following the work of [PFF](https://www.pff.com/).

With this work I'm going to explore Combine + Draft and Tracking data!
