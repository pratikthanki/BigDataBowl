## NFL Big Data Bowl 

In early 2020 the NFL launched its second [Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020) competition on Kaggle, most/all entries for this were written in Python or R.

This is my attempt to use [TensorFlow.NET](https://scisharp.github.io/SciSharp/) and more generally, the C# and the .NET stack to answer the question;

> How many yards will an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff?
